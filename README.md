- Press the `Select Images` button to add pictures to the gif, the images will appear in the order that you select them here.
  `Duration` values are in seconds. So setting duration to 1 means that each image/frame will appear for 1 second on screen.
  You can also choose to resize the images to fit the largest or smallest image in the list, or manually specify the height and width for the final gif.
